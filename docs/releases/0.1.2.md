D2 now has an official playground site: [https://play.d2lang.com](https://play.d2lang.com). It loads and runs fast, works on all the major browsers and has been tested on desktop and mobile on a variety of devices. It's the easiest way to get started with D2 and share diagrams. The playground is all open source ([https://github.com/terrastruct/d2-playground](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2-playground)). We'd love to hear your feedback and feature requests.

Windows users, the install experience just got a whole lot better. Making D2 accessible and easy to use continues to be a priority for us. With this release, we added an MSI installer for Windows, so that installs are just a few clicks. An official Docker image has also been added.
