# Sketch (Hand-drawn)

D2 can render diagrams to give the aesthetic of a hand-drawn sketch.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/screenshots/sketch-1.png').default} alt="sketch
example" />

- In Terrastruct, you can enable this with hand-drawn mode.
- If you're using the CLI, this is enabled by the `--sketch` flag.
- [https://play.d2lang.com](https://play.d2lang.com/?script=qlDQtVOo5AIEAAD__w%3D%3D&sketch=1)
  supports this as well.
