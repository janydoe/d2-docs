# Layouts

D2 supports using a different layout engines. The choice of layout engines can
significantly influence your overall diagram. Each layout also has varying degrees of
support for certain keywords. Though we try our best to keep things consistent, ultimately
we have the most control over our custom-built layout engine and are limited by what the
other layout engines support.

## Layout engines

- [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) (default): A fast, directed graph
  layout engine that produces layered/hierarchical layouts. Based on Graphviz's DOT
  algorithm.
- [ELK](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs): Also a directed graph layout engine. More mature
  than dagre, better maintained (part-time academic research team working on it), with
  recent releases.
- [TALA](https://github.com/terrastruct/TALA): New layout engine designed
  specifically for software architecture diagrams. Requires separate install, visit the
  Github page for more, including samples.

D2 intends to integrate with a variety of layout engines, e.g. `dot`, as well as
single-purpose layout types like sequence diagrams. You can choose whichever layout engine
you like and works best for the diagram you're making.

To compare D2 renders with the various layout engines, visit
[https://text-to-diagram.com](https://text-to-diagram.com) and toggle the layout engines
in the comparison settings.

To see available layouts on your machine, you can run `d2 layout`.

To specify the layout used, you can either set the flag `--layout=dagre` or set it as an
environment variable, `$D2_LAYOUT=dagre`.

## Direction

Set `direction` to one of the following to influence an explicit direction your diagram
flows towards.

:::info Options
- `up`
- `down`
- `right`
- `left`
:::

```d2
direction: right
x -> y -> z: hello
```

<div
className="embedSVG" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: require('@site/static/img/generated/direction-right.svg2')}}></div>

```d2
direction: up
x -> y -> z: hello
```

<div
className="embedSVG" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: require('@site/static/img/generated/direction-up.svg2')}}></div>

### Directions per container (TALA only)

:::info
Directions can only be set at a global level for all the layout engines except TALA. This
is a limitation of their algorithms, which are hierarchical and only work in one
direction. We are investigating ways to hack it to work.
:::

```d2
direction: down
a -> b -> c

b: {
  direction: right
  1 -> 2 -> 3
}

a: {
  direction: left
  foo -> bar
}
```
